		<h4>Information:</h4>
		<h1>In 1998, Subaru made a special version of the Impreza called the 22B STI. It was a 2-door with a widebody design to celebrate Subaru's 40th anniversary and their third consecutive win in the FIA World Rally Championship. Only 399 were made, and they sold out quickly after release. Another 25 were made for export markets.</h1>
