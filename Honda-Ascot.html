	<h1>Information:</h1>
    <h4>The Honda Ascot is a compact sedan made by Honda, sold exclusively in Japan from 1989 to 1997. The first generation included two versions: the Ascot and the Ascot Innova, a "pillared hardtop" model. The Innova shared mechanics with the European-market Accord. The second generation, shared with the Honda Rafaga, improved the platform. The name "Ascot" was chosen for its association with elegance, referencing the Ascot Racecourse and Ascot tie. Honda previously used the Ascot name for a range of motorcycles in the 1980s.</h4>
