		<h4>Information:</h4>
		<h1>The Toyota MR2 is a sporty two-seater car made by Toyota in Japan from 1984 to 2007. It's known for its rear mid-engine layout and was made in three generations: W10, W20, and W30. With its inline-four engine and rear-wheel drive, it offers a fun driving experience. The name MR2 signifies "mid-ship run-about 2-seater" or "mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive, 2-seater," though in French-speaking regions, it was called the Toyota MR due to pronunciation similarities with a profanity.</h1>
