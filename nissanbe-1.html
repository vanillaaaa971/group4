	<h4>Information:</h4>
	<h1>The "Be-1," showcased at the 26th Tokyo Motor Show in 1985, aimed for a "Coziness-oriented Car" concept. Based on the first-generation March K10, its design evoked nostalgia for classic cars. Named after "Plan B-1," it exceeded expectations upon release in January 1987, with over 10,000 orders made for a production limit of 10,000. Buyers were chosen by lottery. The Be-1 paved the way for Nissan's Pike Car Series, including the PAO and FIGARO, known for their unique and limited production.</h1>
