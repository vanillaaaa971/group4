	<h4>Information:</h4>
	<h1>The Nissan Figaro, produced in 1991, is a distinctive two-door convertible with a fixed-profile design and 2+2 seating arrangement. Originally sold exclusively through Nissan Cherry Stores, it shares the front-engine, front-wheel-drive setup of the Nissan March/Micra. Despite a production run of just one year and limited to right-hand drive, its popularity soared, especially through grey imports to Britain and Ireland. Part of Nissan's "Pike cars" lineup, it blends retro styling cues from iconic models like the CitroÃ«n 2CV and Mini, earning acclaim for its postmodernist approach.</h1>
