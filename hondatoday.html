	<h4>Information:</h4>
	<h1>The Honda Today, a kei car by Honda, debuted in 1985, marking the company's return to this segment after a hiatus since 1975. It filled the gap left by the Civic, Honda's smallest car until then, introducing compactness within kei car regulations. Eventually replaced by the Honda Life in 1998, the Today's legacy continued with a 50 cc scooter produced in China from 2002 to 2016.</h1>
