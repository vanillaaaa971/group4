	<h1>Information:</h1>
	<h4>In the '80s and '90s, Honda had the CR-X, a fun and affordable ride. Decades later, they revisited that idea with a greener twist, creating the CR-Z, or "Compact Renaissance Zero." While it's been around since 2010, it only arrived in our market in 2013. The updated version launched in January is the last before it's discontinued later this year. Is the CR-Z a sporty hybrid worth it, or just a marketing move by Honda? Let's see.</h4>
