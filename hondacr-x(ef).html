	<h4>Information:</h4>
	<h1>The Honda CR-X, known as the Ballade Sports CR-X in Japan, was a front-wheel-drive sport compact car manufactured by Honda from 1983 to 1991. It gained popularity for its performance, handling, and fuel efficiency, with over 400,000 units produced. In the U.S., it was sold as an economy sport Kammback with two seats, while in other markets, it offered a 2+2 seating arrangement. Redesigned in 1988, the CR-X was eventually succeeded by the CR-X del Sol.</h1>
