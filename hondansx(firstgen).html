		<h1>Information:</h1>
		<h4>In the mid-1980s, Honda experimented with a mid-engined setup in a modified Honda City. This led to the development of the NSX, a sports car designed to rival European counterparts in performance. Led by designers Nakano and Uehara, the NSX marked Honda's entry into the high-performance sports car market.</h4>
