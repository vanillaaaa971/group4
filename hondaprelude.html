	<h4>Information:</h4>
	<h1>The Honda Prelude is a sporty two-door coupe produced by Honda from 1978 to 2001. Loosely based on the Accord, it featured a distinctive moonroof as standard. Introduced alongside Honda Verno, it later saw international release. Production ended in 2001 with the arrival of the fourth-generation Integra. The name "Prelude" was originally trademarked by Toyota but was granted to Honda.</h1>
