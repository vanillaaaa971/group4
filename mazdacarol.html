	<h1>The Mazda Carol, a kei car produced by Mazda from 1962 to 1970, saw a revival in 1989 under Mazda's Autozam brand. Since then, it's been a rebadged Suzuki Alto, maintaining its presence in the kei car class. Initially featuring unique bodywork, later models have been primarily badge-engineered versions.</h1>
