	<h1>Information:</h1>
    <h4>The Nissan Sentra, produced since 1982, has transitioned from a subcompact to a compact car. Initially a rebadged version of the Japanese Sunny, it's now based on the Sylphy. In North America, it's Nissan's compact offering, though it's classified as mid-size by the EPA due to its interior space. In some countries like Mexico, earlier models were known as the Nissan Tsuru. The name "Sentra" was chosen to convey safety despite its size.</h4>
