	<h1>Information:</h1>
    <h4>Information. The Nissan SilEighty is a modified version of the Nissan 180SX, where the front end is replaced with that of a Nissan Silvia S13. This modification was usually done when a 180SX was damaged, as the front end of a Silvia S13 was cheaper than that of a 180SX (likely due to the 180SX's headlights).</h4>

	<h1>Description:</h1>
	<h4>The Nissan Sileighty is a unique hybrid of two iconic models: the Nissan Silvia and the Nissan 180SX. It's essentially a 180SX with a Silvia front end, created by enthusiasts who wanted the performance of the 180SX with the sleeker look of the Silvia. This custom modification gained popularity in the drifting scene in Japan during the late 1990s and early 2000s.</h4>
