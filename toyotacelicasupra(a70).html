		<h1>Information:</h1>
		<h1>Toyota redesigned the Celica Supra in 1981, known as the Celica XX in Japan. Key differences included a longer wheelbase, retractable headlights, and a six-cylinder engine. The front suspension used Macpherson struts while the rear used a semi-trailing link design. Japanese buyers had a liftback option called the Soarer coupe, while the performance saloon called the Celica Camry was realigned with the Carina.</h1>
