		<h4>Information:</h4>
		<h1>The Toyota Chaser is a mid-size sedan produced by Toyota in Japan, typically available as a four-door sedan or hardtop. It shares its platform with the Toyota Cressida/Mark II and the Cresta, allowing Toyota to market the same platform across different dealership channels. Known for its sporty image and luxury features, the Chaser offers buyers a slightly smaller alternative to the Crown sedan.</h1>
