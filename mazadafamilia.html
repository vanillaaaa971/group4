In Japan, it was sold as the Familia, meaning "family" in Latin. Exported under different names like "800", "1000", and "1300", it evolved into the Mazda3/Axela in 2004. Rebranded as the Ford Laser, Meteor, Escort, and Tracer in different regions, it also spawned wagon/van variants like the Mazda Familia Wagon/Van.
