	<h4>Information:</h4>
	<h1>The Mitsubishi Eclipse, produced from 1989 to 2011, is a sport compact car with a convertible option introduced in 1996. The first two generations shared platforms with the Eagle Talon and Plymouth Laser as part of the Diamond-Star Motors partnership with Chrysler. Later generations adopted platforms from Chrysler models like the Sebring and Stratus. The Eclipse was named after an 18th-century English racehorse known for its unbeaten record. The final Eclipse was manufactured in 2011 and auctioned for charity. Mitsubishi revived the Eclipse name in 2017 for a compact crossover, the Eclipse Cross.</h1>
