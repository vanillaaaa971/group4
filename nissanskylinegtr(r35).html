	<h4>The Nissan GT-R (R35) is a high-performance car made by Nissan since 2007. It has a 2+2 seating layout and is both a sports car and a grand tourer. The engine is front-mid mounted and drives all four wheels. It's the successor to the Nissan Skyline GT-R, although it's no longer part of the Skyline lineup. The GT-R is built on the PM platform, derived from the Skyline and Nissan Z models. Development began in 2000 as part of the Nissan Revival Plan, with the production version unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show. It features advanced aerodynamics, the VR38DETT engine, an active suspension system, and the ATTESA E-TS Pro all-wheel-drive system. The GT-R holds records for acceleration and is praised for its performance and affordability. Despite its accolades, sales are limited due to regulations in certain markets.</h4>
