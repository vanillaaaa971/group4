    <h4>Suzuki pioneered the kei car in 1955. In 1971, they launched the Fronte Coupé, a compact GT car. It had a 2+2 seating layout and was powered by a 359cc two-stroke engine. Discontinued in 1976 due to regulations, Suzuki returned in 1977 with the Cervo SS20. It had a 539cc engine and retained the Fronte Coupé's design with practical modifications like a rear glass hatch for cargo access.</h4>
